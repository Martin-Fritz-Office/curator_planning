# Salary and Fee Research List (100 Art/Museum Jobs)

This folder contains a **100-job search seed list** for contemporary art, museums, and galleries:

- `art_museum_salary_fee_search_list.csv`

## How to use

1. Start with the `search_string` column for each job title.
2. Open the `recommended_source_links` URLs directly to begin source collection.
3. Prioritize local/regional sources first (public pay scales, museum union agreements, municipal pay tables).
4. Validate with at least 2 market sources (e.g., AAM survey + job-board salary ranges).
5. Track currency, gross/net basis, and whether ranges are annual salary, day-rate, or project fee.
6. Store final validated numbers in a separate cleaned dataset for your app.

## Notes on ranges

- Salary/day/project ranges in the CSV are **starter benchmarks for search prioritization**, not final compensation recommendations.
- Always normalize by:
  - country/city
  - institution type (public museum, nonprofit kunsthalle, commercial gallery)
  - seniority and scope (team lead, budget ownership, fundraising target)
  - contract type (staff vs freelance)
